# SqlQueryGenerator
A library for easing SQL data access code. This library aims to reduce duplicate code and increase readability of your code by providing common functionality. This library doesn't cover every aspect of a huge ORM such as EntityFramework but it provides a flexible usage where you can either use the fully automatic functionality or you can increase your code quality by using the manual functionality where the automatic functionality is not enough. Also with this library, unlike in pure Dapper you can use nested query objects. And another thing, you have the "OptionSet" value with the C# attributes that this library provides. By editing this value you can tag the same property multiple times with the attribute where each attribute can be used for different profiles/use cases. Eg: Suppose you have model "Foo" and you can insert it to two different tables, "A" and "B", you can have two different mappings on the same model for the corresponding table.
